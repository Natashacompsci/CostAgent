Vector databases have emerged as a critical component in modern AI and machine learning
pipelines. Unlike traditional relational databases that store structured data in rows and
columns, vector databases are designed to efficiently store, index, and query high-dimensional
vectors — numerical representations of data such as text, images, or audio.

At the heart of a vector database is the concept of embeddings. When a piece of text is
processed by a language model, it is converted into a dense numerical vector that captures
its semantic meaning. Two sentences with similar meanings will have vectors that are close
together in the embedding space, even if their surface-level wording differs significantly.

The primary operation in a vector database is similarity search, also known as nearest
neighbor search. Given a query vector, the database finds the stored vectors that are most
similar, typically measured using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. This enables
applications like semantic search, recommendation engines, and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for large language models.

Popular vector database solutions include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant, and Chroma.
Each offers different trade-offs between scalability, ease of use, and feature set. Some
are cloud-hosted services, while others can be run locally or self-hosted.

Key challenges in the vector database space include handling billions of vectors efficiently,
maintaining real-time update capabilities, filtering results based on metadata alongside
vector similarity, and managing the cost of storing and querying large embedding collections.

As AI applications continue to grow in complexity, vector databases will play an increasingly
important role in bridging the gap between raw data and intelligent, context-aware AI systems.
